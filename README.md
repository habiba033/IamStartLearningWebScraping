# IamStartLearningWebScraping
This is my very first web scraping project using Python and BeautifulSoup.

I’m following AMIT’s course to learn how to:
- Fetch a website using HTTP requests.
- Parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
- Extract meaningful data like titles, prices, or links.
- Store the data in files like `.csv` or `.txt`.

This repo is made for practice purposes only, and I’ll keep updating it as I learn more. 

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3
- `requests` for sending HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML
- `pandas` (optional) for storing in `.csv`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IamStartLearningWebScraping.git
   cd IamStartLearningWebScraping
